This Machine learning project predicts whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
The logistic regression model is used here and got ROC AUC score of 0.79 after hyperparameter tuning. SMOTE oversampling was used to handle imbalanced dataset. The front end is built using Streamlit and the application is deployed on Heroku Cloud Platform.
